# Concept - Job

## Each concept contains everything needed to support CRUD operations on it's particular data structure
* ts_defs.ts - Typescript file defining the data structure
* TSX componenets for displaying and updating
	* sect_EmpHistory.tsx - A component that retrieves data from "../../pages/ComponentizedResume/resumeData" to display it organized in nested divs.
	* Haven't created the edit component yet.  For now, just edit "../../pages/ComponentizedResume/resumeData"
	*  Eventually, it should have something for searching
